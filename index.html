Eco-savvy props from the things lying about 
your home One person’s trash is another’s treasure 
– just ask Wall-E. In the same vein, and by adding 
a mere splash of creativity, 
A good motivational letter is a one-pager where you introduce yourself, your story, and show your interest in the position or organization you are applying to.

There are two main ways to structure your motivational letter:

Using the classic 3 main paragraphs structure, where your motivational letter has the introduction, the body, and the conclusion. 
Using the 5-7 paragraph structure, where you divide your main body paragraph into smaller 1-3 sentence paragraphs according to the main points.
Now, which one do YOU go for? The rule of thumb is if you want to be more factual and to the point, go for the 7-paragraph structure. This way, you can use each body paragraph to discuss specific achievements or points.

If, on the other hand, you’re going for a more story-telling approach, you’d go for the 3 paragraph option, so as not to break the flow of the story.
